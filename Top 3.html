                Pop Out was released on February 1, 2019 as a single. It is part of Polo G’s debut studio album Die a Legend. Pop Out reached #11 on the Billboard Hot 100.
                It was both Polo G’s and Lil Tjay’s first entry on the Hot 100. Pop Out is a more upbeat song, that is conisdered more hype music. 
                This is Polo G's song that Lil Tjay features on. Many consider this song to one of if not the best, feature Lil Tjay has on a song. This is one of his first 
                Popular songs that put hi on the map.

                Mood Swings is from Pop Smoke’s posthumous debut studio album Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon.
                It was released as a single on August 21st, 2020. This song is a more romantic R&B song that talks about
                a relationship with a women. Lil Tjays verse in this song expresses his deep feelings for a women and his emotional attactchment.
                This is my favorite Lil Tjay feature on all of his released music, so i beleive it deserves the hype.

                Calling My Phone was released on February 10, 2021. It is part of Lil Tjay’s second studio album, Destined 2 Win. The song features 6lack as a guest vocalist. 
                The song leans into R&B, with a melancholic, emotional vibe rather than an aggressive rap beat. This song is a sad song about a past relationship.
                Lil Tjay sings about not wanting to play games, healing from pain, and setting boundaries. This song is perfect for when you are in your feels and 
                is a very relaxing song.
